    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Wear food-grade gloves to avoid burning your hands while removing the jalapeño seeds. Slice the jalapeño in half lengthwise with a paring knife, then use the knife to cut away the seeds and ribs.</p>
    <p>Make the filling by mixing softened cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, and bacon bits. Spoon the mixture into jalapeño halves. </p>
    <p>Dip the jalapeños in milk, then dip them in flour. Let them dry for about 10 minutes, then dip them in milk again. Roll the wet jalapeños in bread crumbs until they're well-coated. Let them dry, then repeat the milk-crumb process once more. Allow the peppers to dry completely.</p>
    <p>Heat oil to 365 degrees F in a skillet. Working in batches, fry the jalapeño poppers until they're golden brown. Drain on paper towels. </p>
    <p>When fried at 365 degrees F, these homemade jalapeño poppers should be beautifully golden brown and crunchy in about two to three minutes. </p>
